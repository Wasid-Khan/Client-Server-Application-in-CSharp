# Client-Server-Application-in-CSharp
This is a client server application. Here the client makes request to the server and server entertains the request. The client and server both are coded explicitly. One can have a look and can learn easily. You can copy and paste the code in you Visual-Studio,however, I will suggest to code it by yourself and keep this program as a reference.
